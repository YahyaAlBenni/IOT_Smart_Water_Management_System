# MQTT-Based Smart Water Management System

## Overview

This project implements an **MQTT-based communication system** to monitor **main tank level, house tank level, and turbidity** using Python and the `paho-mqtt` library. The system consists of:

- **A controller** that sends sensor data (main tank level, house tank level, and turbidity) to the MQTT broker.
- **A server** that subscribes to sensor data, processes notifications, and controls the pump.
- **A user device (mobile app)** that subscribes to sensor updates and receives notifications.

## Implementation Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required `paho-mqtt` package:
pip install paho-mqtt

2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement the MQTT Server:
The server subscribes to sensor topics and processes data.
It sends notifications based on predefined thresholds.
It publishes pump control commands when necessary.

Notification System Triggers:
Main tank is nearly full (‚â•99%) ‚Üí Pump is stopped.
House tank is low (<25%) ‚Üí User is notified to reduce water usage.
Turbidity exceeds 50 NTU ‚Üí User is alerted about water quality.

Run the MQTT server:
python server.py

3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement the Controller
The controller simulates sensor readings by generating random values for:
Main tank level (0-100%)
House tank level (0-100%)
Turbidity (0-100 NTU)
It publishes this data to the MQTT broker every 5 seconds.

Run the controller:
python controller.py

4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement the User Device
The user device subscribes to sensor topics to receive real-time updates.
It also subscribes to notification topics for alerts.
The user can request the latest sensor values by publishing to user/request.

Run the user device:
python user_mobile.py

Results and Observations:
The system successfully transmits sensor data from the controller to the server.
The server processes notifications correctly based on:
High main tank levels (‚â•99%)
Low house tank levels (<25%)
High turbidity (>50 NTU)
Real-time updates work efficiently with an update cycle of ~5 seconds.
MQTT ensures stable communication, but message sizes are slightly larger compared to CoAP due to the publish-subscribe model.

Conclusion:
MQTT is ideal for continuous monitoring and instant notifications.
Higher CPU & latency than CoAP, but provides reliable real-time updates.
