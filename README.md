## Project Overview

The **IoT Water Tank Management System** is designed to optimize water extraction, distribution, quality monitoring, and consumption management within a residential building that relies on a well as its primary water source. By integrating IoT-enabled sensors and a mobile application, the system enhances water usage efficiency, ensures water quality, and reduces operational costs through predictive maintenance.

### Key Features:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Sensors monitor pump health (temperature, vibration, pressure) to prevent failures.
- **Principal Tank Monitoring**: Water level sensors track availability and prevent overflows.
- **Household Monitoring**: Individual tanks are equipped with level, pH, turbidity, and flow sensors to ensure safe usage.
- **Mobile App**: Provides real-time updates on water levels, consumption, and quality, sending alerts for anomalies.

### System Communication:
- **Zigbee**: Used for local sensor communication due to its low power consumption and long range.
- **Wi-Fi**: Connects the system to the cloud for real-time monitoring.
- **Physical Cables**: Used for pump sensors due to significant depth and signal interference.

This project aims to improve water resource management using IoT technology, ensuring sustainability and efficiency in residential water distribution systems.
