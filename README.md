## Project Overview

The **IoT Water Tank Management System** is designed to optimize water extraction, distribution, quality monitoring, and consumption management within a residential building that relies on a well as its primary water source. By integrating IoT-enabled sensors and a mobile application, the system enhances water usage efficiency, ensures water quality, and reduces operational costs through predictive maintenance.

### Key Features:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Sensors monitor pump health (temperature, vibration, pressure) to prevent failures.
- **Control**: Stop the pump when the main tank is full or when there is a risk of failure due to very high temperature and pressure.
- **Principal Tank Monitoring**: Water level sensors track availability and prevent overflows.
- **Household Monitoring**: Individual tanks are equipped with level, pH, turbidity, and flow sensors to ensure safe usage.
- **Mobile App**: Provides real-time updates on water levels, consumption, and quality, sending alerts for anomalies.

This project aims to improve water resource management using IoT technology, ensuring sustainability and efficiency in residential water distribution systems.
